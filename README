"Hello so I favourite lots of videos on youtube to watch them later but it seems youtube has decided to delete videos because of copyright infringements. This isn't the problem the problem is I favourite videos because I want to watch them later. Now I don't even know what the video I Favorited was about/called because when a video is deleted it is renamed to DELETED VIDEO. Is there anyway I can find out what the name of the video was before deleted videos had the title of them but it seems they changed them all to deleted video....."
Yes there is. This may not be GData API but it gets the job done via libcurl (use Firefox plugin to export cookies to file), libtidy and libxml2:

https://github.com/Kasreyn/YouTube-playlist-downloader

This requires cookies and so only works on your own profile but it does include references to "unlinked" videos. In some cases they only have the id/watch reference (deleted by user) while others have a title (unlinked by higher power).

The ones with truncated title (if you click the link) are actually readable from HTML source.

I understand the reasons behind videos getting deleted, but why is the title purged along with it? Actually, it does make sense, that a video deleted by user is purged entirely. Instead of employing a workforce whose job it is to sort through and decide if something might be offensive, hurtful or not.
